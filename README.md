# Diabetes Prediction with Pima Indians Dataset

In this project, my goal was to predict the occurrence of diabetes within the Pima Indian population, known for its high prevalence of diabetes.

## Objectives

I divided this project into four main objectives:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Generate a random training and test set from the data
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis using the `ggplot2` package
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Apply three different machine learning models to the dataset:
   - Linear Model
   - Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
   - Random Forest Model
4. See how well my model performs by anaylzing the results using RMSE and a Confusion Matrix.
